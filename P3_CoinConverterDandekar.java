3. This program uses 2 different methods. It uses one method to print the decription of 
   the program and the second method to calulate the number of each denomination needed 
   to represent the number of Yuan in USD.

4. Grade: 100%

   Explanation: First, my program uses proper Java naming conventions (e.g. "firstSecondThird...").
   Second, it follows proper indentation, easy to follow and navigate, and organized.
   Third, comments are provided for each method to decribe what its function is and 
   how it works. Fourth, my program compiles, runs, and correctly produces the word 
   TENNESSEE using the block letters created by multiple print statements in the 
   method calls. Fifth, the class and all methods are implemented correctly, and it 
   follows all requirements.
